Hi! 
This project is about image colorization using 2 different methods. 
First one is based on the Lab color space and the second uses the GANs.

Requirements : 
For the first method (Lab color space) we will use the dataset of African Fabric from kaggle (Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikuns/african-fabric ).
It countains 1059 images.
